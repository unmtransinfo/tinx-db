# compute_nds_rank.py
#
# Computes the NDS rank for each target in the context of each disease and
# stores that data in the database.
#
# NDS (non-dominated solution) ranking is employed within TIN-X as a method of
# determining which points are the most interesting to show to the user.
#
# To oversimplify: The most interesting points are those that are on the
# northeastern edge of the plot, followed by those that would be on the
# northeastern edge if the actual northeastern edge were removed, and so on.
#
# Codifying this mathematically: We seek to identify a non-dominated solution
# (NDS) to the multi-objective optimization problem of maximizing both
# importance and novelty. That is, we will find a subset of points which
# "dominate" all other points in the plot. We say that a point x1 dominates a
# point x2 if x1 is no worse than x2 in all objectives and if x1 is strictly
# better than x2 in at least one objective. After identifying an NDS, we then
# remove the NDS from the plot -- assigning each point in the NDS the rank 1
# -- and then find an NDS for the remaining points, which we assign the rank 2.
# This process is then repeated until all points have been ranked.
#
# The algorithm is arguably simpler than the explanation:
#
#   1. Let current_rank := 1. Let max_novelty := null.
#
#   2. Iterate through all remaining points by descending importance. For each:
#
#       2.1. If the novelty of the point is greater than max_novelty, or if
#            max_novelty is null, then assign the point the rank current_rank,
#            set max_novelty to the novelty score of this point, and remove the
#            point from the set of remaining points.
#
#   3. If there are remaining points that do not have an assigned rank, then
#      increment current_rank, reset max_novelty to null, and repeat step 2.
